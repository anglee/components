//2.Edit distance

// 1
//Given a classify() method that returns 0, 1, or 2 (representing low, med, high) on an input integer.
// sort an array of integers so in the sorted result, all the category 0(low) are at left,
// and category 2(high) are at right and category 1(med) in the middle.
// i.e. something like [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. And do this in 2 ways (1) straightforward way,
// can use extra space and the result is stable (2) in place, (can be not stable)

//2
//1. adding 2 binary numbers (given as 2 Strings) and return the result in String too.
// Follow up question,
// how do you change your code so it take a extra argument 'base' that can be 2 to 10,
// so your method adds not only binary but also numbers with other bases.
//2. Let's first define what Hamming distance is between a pair of binary numbers.
// Now given a list of binary numbers (as String), calculate the hamming distances between all
// possible pairs(total C(n, 2) pairs) and return the sum. Need to be better than O(n^2)

// 3.

//Find a word in a rectangle of char's.
//for example find a string "BACK":
//on the board (2D array):
//CAX
//KBX
//XXX
//The method take a board and a string and returns a boolean representing found or not.
